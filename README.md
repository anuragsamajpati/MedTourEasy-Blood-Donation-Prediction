# MedTourEasy-Blood-Donation-Prediction
Project Overview:-
This project focuses on predicting blood donations using machine learning techniques, primarily Logistic Regression. The goal is to analyze donor behavior patterns and improve donation predictions. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using scikit-learn. The AUC score is the primary metric for assessing model accuracy, and different models are ranked using operator.itemgetter. The development environment utilizes Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis, ensuring efficient experimentation and model tuning.

• Developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of future blood donations using the Blood Transfusion
Service Center dataset, applying logistic regression and AutoML (TPOT) for pipeline optimization and feature selection.

• Performed data preprocessing, normalization, and AUC-based model evaluation, comparing algorithms such as Random
Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, achieving an AUC score of 0.79+ and identifying key donor
patterns for efficient blood supply forecasting. 

• Technologies Utilized: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TPOT, R Programming, SQL, Jupyter
Notebook, Data Visualization.
